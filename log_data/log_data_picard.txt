 Farpoint Mission Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41153.7. Our destination is planet Deneb IV beyond which lies the great, unexplored mass of the galaxy. My orders are to examine Farpoint, a starbase built there by the inhabitants of that world. Meanwhile, I am becoming better acquainted with my new command this Galaxy-class USS Enterprise. I am still somewhat in awe of its size and complexity. As for my crew, we are short in several key positions most notably, a first officer, but I am informed that a highly experienced man – one Commander William T. Riker – will be waiting to join the ship at our Deneb IV destination." 

    "Captain's Log, supplementary. The frozen form of Lieutenant Torres has been rushed to sickbay. The question now is the incredible power of the Q being. Do we dare oppose it?" 

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41153.7. Preparing to detach saucer section so that families and the majority of the ship's company can seek relative safety while the vessel's stardrive containing the battle bridge and main armaments will turn back and confront the mystery that is threatening us." 

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41174.2. The agreement for the rebuilding of Farpoint Station has been completed per my instructions." (TNG: "Encounter at Farpoint") 

Rendezvous with the SS Tsiolkovsky Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41209.2. We are running at warp 7 to rendezvous with the science vessel SS Tsiolkovsky which has been routinely monitoring the collapse of a red supergiant star into a white dwarf. What has brought us here is a series of strange messages indicating something has gone wrong aboard the research vessel." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We are downloading the research information gathered on the collapsing star nearby. I am concerned at being in such close orbit but the Tsiolkovsky's research records will no doubt predict the time of the star's final collapse." 

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41209.3. The strange contaminant that led to the deaths of the Tsiolkovsky crew is now aboard the Enterprise and our engineering section has been commandeered by young Wesley Crusher." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. It is no longer an inconvenient childish prank. Young Wesley Crusher, admittedly a victim of the Tsiolkovsky infection is now in control of my starship." (TNG: "The Naked Now") 

Mission to Ligon II Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41235.25. Our location, planet Ligon II. Source of a rare vaccine needed on Federation planet Styris IV. Starfleet has instructed me to engage in a friendly visit and open treaty negotiations to acquire this medicinal substance." 

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41235.32. I am concerned over a full day of waiting with no response from Lutan. We are now testing whether they are aware of our sensors probing them. So far, we believe we have pinpointed Lutan's government compound." (TNG: "Code of Honor") 

First contact with the Ferengi Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41386.4. We are in pursuit of a starship of Ferengi design. Our mission is to intercept and recover a T-9 energy converter which the Ferengi stole from an unmanned monitor post on Gamma Tauri IV a theft which automatic scanners recorded providing us with the long-awaited opportunity to make close contact with a Ferengi vessel. If we succeed in this chase it will be Starfleet's first look at a lifeform which, discounting rumor, we know almost nothing about." 

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41386.5. It is with a heavy heart that I have offered to meet whatever reasonable and necessary terms are demanded by the Ferengi. I fear for my people and my vessel in the event the unknown Ferengi ask the unreasonable. How can I oppose even unreasonable demands?" 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. In orbit of a mysterious planet whose unexplained force field has seized us with a power almost beyond imagination. If there is a solution to this it almost certainly will involve cooperation from the Ferengi." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. It is now six hours since our away team beamed down to the planet's surface. On the Enterprise our condition is rapidly worsening. Ordinarily, with reserve power alone we could maintain life support for several months. But the force holding us has closed down all engines and is draining our reserve power, too." (TNG: "The Last Outpost") 

Propulsion upgrades Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41263.1. We have rendezvoused with the USS Fearless from which a Starfleet propulsion expert and his assistant are beaming over to conduct tests on the Enterprise's warp drive engines." 

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41263.2. This will be a rather unusual log entry assuming Starfleet ever receives it. As I've already informed my crew a phenomenal surge of power during a warp speed experiment has sent our starship hurtling out of our own galaxy and past another taking us over 2,700,000 light years in a few minutes." 

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41263.3. Instead of returning to our own galaxy the Enterprise has gone forward to a place in the universe which is uncharted and unknown. Our present position puts us at over a billion light years from our galaxy." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. Our position is unknown and our only chance of returning to the known universe is a dying alien who is generally humanoid but with a physiology sufficiently different from our own to create medical problems in caring for him." 

    "Captain's Log: Any time entry is meaningless. We have no choice but to repeat the same warp experiment but with one variation. A principal part of this warp formula will be the thoughts of everyone aboard the Enterprise. We have no idea exactly how this works. We understand only that the Traveler makes use of this somehow. It will be most important that those aboard avoid random thoughts that might change the reality of what we're attempting to do." 

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41263.4. For outstanding performance in the best Starfleet tradition Wesley Crusher is made acting Ensign with the duties and privileges of that rank and whether that rank becomes permanent, Mr. Crusher depends on you." (TNG: "Where No One Has Gone Before") 

Mission to Parliament Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41249.3. We have orbited the two major planets of the Beta Renner system taking aboard delegates from those two worlds. Since achieving space flight their major lifeforms – the Anticans and the Selay – have become deadly enemies but both have also applied for admission into our Federation. We are to deliver these delegates to this sector's neutral conference planet – called Parliament – in the hope their dispute can be resolved." 

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41249.4. I've ordered an immediate investigation into the death of Assistant Chief Engineer Singh. We continue to run on impulse power." (TNG: "Lonely Among Us") 

Mission to Rubicun III Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41255.6. After delivering a party of Earth colonists to the Strnad solar system we have discovered another class M planet in the adjoining Rubicun star system. We are now in orbit there having determined it to be inhabited as well as unusually lovely. My first officer has taken an away team down to make contact and they are in the process of returning to the ship." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We are in orbit of a planet designated Rubicun III the home of a lifeform who call themselves the Edo. Our away team, including Wesley Crusher, has beamed down to make some arrangements concerning some well-earned recreation." 

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41255.9. Whatever the object or vessel in orbit with us it hangs there like a "nemesis". It is one thing to communicate with something mysterious but it is quite another to be silently observed by it. I am concerned whether it understands the same concept of reason that we do." (TNG: "Justice") 

Mission to the Xendi Sabu system Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41723.9. In response to a Starfleet order we are in the Xendi Sabu star system having rendezvoused with a Ferengi vessel which has requested a meeting. Although we arrived here and made appropriate signals to the Ferengi three days ago they have so far responded only with the message, "Stand by, Enterprise."" 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. Bok and his officers have returned to their vessel inviting us now to officially take possession of the Stargazer." (TNG: "The Battle") 

Mission to Quadra Sigma III Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41590.5. Having dropped off Counselor Troi at Starbase G-6 for a shuttle visit home we were fortunately close to the Sigma III solar system when its Federation colony transmitted an urgent call for medical help. An accidental explosion has devastated has a mining operation there." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. Our rescue mission to the Sigma III solar system has been halted by an immense grid and an untimely visit from Q." 

    "Starlog entry, Stardate: today. This is Q speaking for Captain Jean-Luc Picard, whom we consider to be too bound by Starfleet customs and traditions to be of use to us. The Enterprise is now helpless; stuck like an Earth insect in amber, while its bridge crew plays out a game whose real intent is to test whether the first officer is worthy of the greatest gift the Q can offer." 

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41591.4. Twelve minutes out from Quadra Sigma III where the survivors of an underground disaster desperately need our help. Aboard the Enterprise First Officer William T. Riker needs help nearly as badly. But this is a subject far out of my experience – out of any Human's experience." (TNG: "Hide and Q") 

Mission to Haven Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41294.5. Our destination: the class M Beta Cassius planet known simply as Haven. It is a world so renowned for its peaceful beauty that some believe it to have mystical healing powers. We will rest and relax... all too briefly, I fear." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. It has been believed the Tarellian race was extinct an assumption contradicted by the sight of one of their vessels approaching Haven." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. All attempts at warning off the Tarellian ship have failed. They still refuse to communicate and I'm growing concerned." 

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41294.6. Orbiting Haven with a Tarellian vessel locked in our tractor beam. Question: what strange combination of circumstances has caused a woman out of someone's imagination to appear on the plague ship?" (TNG: "Haven") 

Mission to Omicron Theta Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41242.4. Our last assignment has taken us into the remote Omicron Theta star system, home of our android crewmember Lieutenant Commander Data. Although we are due at our next assignment, I have decided to Data's home planet for a few hours in the hopes of unraveling some of the mystery of his beginnings." 

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41242.45. Despite having only a few hours in which to explore Data's home planet we have discovered something which may explain Data's beginnings if we can properly assemble and communicate with what we've found." 

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41242.5. Thanks to Lore's report, we now know what happened to the colonists. Beginning with a child's drawing, enhanced by Lore's description, our computer has constructed an image of a great Crystalline Entity which feeds on life, insatiably ravenous for the life force found in living forms, capable of stripping all life from an entire world." (TNG: "Datalore") 

Mission to Angel I Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41636.9. As feared, our examination of the seven-year overdue Federation freighter, Odin, disabled by an asteroid collision revealed no life signs. However, three escape pods were missing suggesting the possibility of survivors." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. Our away team has beamed down to an unusual matriarchal society where the female is as aggressively dominant as the male gender was on Earth for hundreds of years ago. Here, the female is the hunter, soldier, larger and stronger than the male, an arrangement considered most sensible and natural." (TNG: "Angel One") 

Maintenance check at Starbase 74 Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41365.9. The Enterprise has been ordered to Starbase 74 in orbit around Tarsas III. A routine maintenance check of all systems will be made and certain upgrades completed including the holodeck, with which we've had problems. I anticipate a glowing report. This ship has performed magnificently beyond anyone's expectations." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We now know who has commandeered the Enterprise – the Bynars. We can't communicate with the bridge. Commander Riker and I will now try to regain control of our ship." (TNG: "11001001") 

Mission to Mordan IV Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41309.5. We are in orbit around Persephone V where I have been sent to confer with Admiral Mark Jameson in regard to an extraordinary situation." (TNG: "Too Short a Season") 

Discovery of Aldea Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41509.1. Either by chance or intent we've been led to the planet Aldea which appeared out of nowhere hidden behind a sophisticated shielding device." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We remain in orbit around Aldea. It's becoming all too evident that talk will not effect the return of our children. We must neutralize the Aldean shield. Until then, we are helpless." 

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41512.4. We are 20 hours away from Aldea and no closer to a solution. Their deliberate show of force pushed us out of orbit and could've easily disintegrated the ship." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. It has been three days since the Aldeans pushed us away. We have had no contact with Radue since then." (TNG: "When The Bough Breaks") 

Mission to Velara III Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41463.9. While mapping the Pleiades Cluster, we've been asked by the Federation to visit a group terraforming Velara III. Communications have been erratic and there is some concern about their welfare." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. On my order, Data's startling discovery of a possible lifeform has been beamed aboard. So that its true nature might be uncovered but unlike life on Earth and elsewhere it appears to be completely inorganic." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. The inorganic lifeform from Velara III has apparently taken over our medical lab." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. The lifeform, which has significantly increased in size, is again attempting to communicating with us." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We have regained visual contact with the lab but our attempts to restore communication with this microbrain, as we have come to call it, have been unsuccessful. One thing that is certain however, this lifeform has declared war on us." 

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41464.8. I have declared an indefinite quarantine for Velara III and we are now returning to Starbase with the three surviving terraformers. Perhaps the lesson we have learned from this near tragedy will prevent it from happening elsewhere." (TNG: "Home Soil") 

Mission to Relva VII Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41416.2. We are orbiting Relva VII where Wesley Crusher is about to be tested for entrance to Starfleet Academy. And to my great surprise, I have just learned that my old friend, Admiral Gregory Quinn is on Relva VII and has requested to be beamed aboard the Enterprise immediately." (TNG: "Coming of Age") 

Disturbance in the Neutral Zone Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41503.7. We have entered the Neutral Zone where a Talarian freighter has been severely damaged in a battle. I have sent an away team to investigate." (TNG: "Heart of Glory") 

Mission to Minos Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41798.2. We have been ordered by Starfleet to proceed to the Lorenze Cluster and investigate the disappearance of the light cruiser USS Drake, which was in that system trying to unravel a mystery of its own which began when recent long-range probes indicated that all intelligent life on the planet Minos had disappeared." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. I've ordered an away team to beam down to Minos to investigate the disappearance of the Drake. Although there are no signs of intelligent life coming from the heavily forested planet, I'm far from certain that it is devoid of danger." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. Some kind of weapon which, for a time, took the form of Captain Paul Rice has enveloped Commander Riker." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. Lieutenant La Forge in command. I am unable to beam up the away team due to an unseen assailant attacking the ship. To make matters worse, Chief Engineer Logan is on his way to the bridge and he's not paying a courtesy call." (TNG: "The Arsenal of Freedom") 

First contact with Armus Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41601.3. We are crossing through the Zed Lapis sector where we will rendezvous with shuttlecraft 13 carrying Deanna Troi who is returning from a conference. Because engineering is involved in preventive maintenance on our dilithium crystals, we are presently traveling on impulse power." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We've lost all contact with shuttlecraft 13 and can only assume they've crash-landed on Vagra II. Meanwhile, main engineering is trying to return us to warp power." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. While on a mission to rescue survivors from an unexplained shuttle crash, the away team has encountered a strange creature which seems able to assume different forms including one which resembles humanoid." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. There is grave danger to the crew on Vagra II. My first officer is missing – attacked by this entity known as Armus." 

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41602.1: The shuttlecraft has been destroyed to prevent any possibility of Armus leaving the planet. Vagra II will be declared off-limits but the damage has been done. One of the saddest duties I've ever had to perform is now ahead of me." (TNG: "Skin of Evil") 

Mission to Vandor IV Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41697.9. We're en route to Sarona VIII for much needed shore leave. The entire crew is looking forward to the diversion. On a personal note, I have allowed myself the luxury of a head start." (TNG: "We'll Always Have Paris") 

Mission to Pacifica Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 41780.2. How difficult after all these years of learning to respect life to be forced to destroy it. But there seems to be no alternative. Admiral Quinn is expected to make a full recovery. There is no trace of the parasite which took control of him. We'll never know how many of these lifeforms infiltrated Starfleet but it seems they could not survive without the mother creature which had taken over Commander Remmick." (TNG: "Conspiracy") 

Mission to Neutral Zone Edit

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We have arrived at the edge of the Neutral Zone where we will now have an opportunity to learn firsthand what happened to our distant outposts." (TNG: "The Neutral Zone") 


 Mission to Science Station Tango Sierra Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 42073.1. There has been an outbreak of an unclassified plasma plague in the Rachelis system. We're on an emergency run to collect specimens of the deadly plague and transport them to Science Station Tango Sierra where hopefully an antidote can be produced." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We have finally arrived at 'aucdet IX where we will pick up the specimens of plasma plague for transport to Rachelis. It is only because so many lives are at stake that I'm willing to put this ship and crew at great risk. Meanwhile, Counselor Troi's pregnancy continues to progress at an astonishing rate." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. Although it's been nearly 14 hours since we arrived at 'aucdet IX, Hester Dealt has still not completed his inspection of the containment unit. The transfer will not be permitted until he is assured of zero growth during our voyage. Meanwhile, the desperate pleas from the Rachelis system continue." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We are faced with two major problems – Troi's child and the deadly cargo we're about to take on. In the hours since his birth, Troi's baby has continued his rapid growth and now appears physically and mentally to be a child of eight. Still, there is no indication as to who he is or why he is here." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. For reasons as yet unknown one of the deadly specimens of plasma plague has begun to grow." (TNG: "The Child") 

First contact with Nagilum Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 42193.6. We're on a long reach toward the Morgana Quadrant, a section of the galaxy which has yet to be visited by a manned Federation vessel. We are using the time to further detail the charts of the region." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. While exploring a strange void in space without any form of matter or energy, we have apparently moved past its outer boundary and entered it. After a brief disruption, our ship's communications have returned to normal." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We remain, like a fly in amber, trapped in the void. We have encountered a vessel which appears to be the USS Yamato. All its systems are shown as functioning yet it seems devoid of life. Commander Riker is leading an away team. Hopefully, the answer lies there." 

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 42194.7. It is obvious that whatever we have met sees no value in our kind of lifeform. How do we fight something that both is and is not there?" (TNG: "Where Silence Has Lease") 

Rendezvous with USS Victory Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 42286.3. We have arrived on station at coordinates 3629 by 584 three days early for our rendezvous with the USS Victory. There is nothing to do now but hold this position and wait." (TNG: "Elementary, Dear Data") 

Passing through the Omega Sagitta system Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 42402.7. We are traveling in the Omega Sagitta system, traversing between the twin planets that form the Coalition of Madena. Both worlds are populated by a humanoid race which colonized the planets two centuries ago and which now coexist under a precarious but successful treaty." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. Some of the mystery surrounding this ancient morality play we've been dragged into has been revealed. One of Captain Okona's pursuers is an outraged father with a heartfelt, if arcane, sense of righteousness." (TNG: "The Outrageous Okona") 

Mission to Solais V Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 42477.2. The Enterprise has been diverted to the Ramatis star system. It seems that both sides of a bitter planetary conflict have petitioned Starfleet to transport to their world a mediator they have mutually selected. Our orders are transportation only. No interference." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We are monitoring increased military activity on Solais V. I fear that without Riva we will be unable to keep the Solari from destroying themselves." (TNG: "Loud As A Whisper") 

Mission to Gravesworld Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 42437.7. We've successfully repaired the stricken liner USS Constantinople. 46 of her people suffered injuries, mostly minor. They have been treated and supplied with the proper medicines. Our task complete, we are heading back to Gravesworld with great dispatch." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. I leave Gravesworld with an empty feeling in the knowledge that our mission was unsuccessful. Whatever scientific secrets Ira Graves was about to unlock have been lost forever. Our immediate priority is to reach the nearest starbase so that Graves's assistant can get on with her life." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We've said good-bye to Kareen Brianon with the hopeful feeling that her future will be a bright one. The intellect of Ira Graves has been deposited into our computer. There is knowledge, but no consciousness. The Human equation has been lost." (TNG: "The Schizoid Man") 

Mission to Gagarin IV Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 42494.8. The Enterprise is bound for Star Station India to rendezvous with a Starfleet Medical courier. We've been told only that our presence is imperative. Hopefully, the mission will give me further opportunities to assess the performance of our new chief medical officer." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We're en route to the Federation Research Station on Gagarin IV. The mere thought of a possible connection between the USS Lantree tragedy and a genetic research facility fills me with profound apprehension." (TNG: "Unnatural Selection") 

Officer Exchange Program Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 42506.5. We have departed from Starbase 179 and are headed for a rendezvous with the Klingon vessel Pagh. I have informed the staff of Commander Riker's temporary assignment." 

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 42507.8. Although our search has been extensive, we are still unable to locate the Klingon ship or any evidence of its destruction." (TNG: "A Matter Of Honor") 

Port call at Starbase 173 Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 42523.7. We are en route to newly-established Starbase 173 for port call. Crew rotation is scheduled, and we will be off-loading experiment modules." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. Commander Bruce Maddox, having been thwarted by Data's abrupt resignation is now seeking a legal remedy for his woes. Captain Louvois has requested my presence at those discussions." (TNG: "The Measure Of A Man") 

Mission to Daled IV Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 42568.8. Since Anya's powers of transformation apparently gave her the ability to escape her guards unnoticed we have sealed her quarters with a force field that will contain her no matter how small a form she make take." (TNG: "The Dauphin") 

Mission to Iconia Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 42609.1. In response to a desperate plea from my old friend Captain Donald Varley of the USS Yamato, I am running a grave risk by taking the Enterprise into the Neutral Zone. Varley's request was prompted by dangerous malfunctions which have been plaguing our sister ship. Perhaps with both crews working together we can eliminate the problems before our presence is detected by the Romulans." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. The Yamato's entire crew and their families, more than a thousand people, have been lost. Circumstances, unfortunately, permit us no pause for grief." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. As happened with our sister ship, the Enterprise is beginning to experience a series of system failures. So far, they are random, but I fear they could be early symptoms of what happened to the Yamato'" 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. While there is little left on the surface of Iconia, we've found what appears to be a control center which seems to have remained intact." (TNG: "Contagion") 

Mission to Theta VIII Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 42625.4. We are entering orbit around the eighth planet of the previously unmapped Theta 116 solar system. We diverted from our scheduled course when a passing Klingon cruiser reported discovering pieces of a strange vessel in the upper atmosphere of this planet. We've come to investigate." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We remain in orbit around Theta VIII still out of contact with the away team." (TNG: "The Royale") 

First contact with Temporal Entity Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 42679.2. While en route to the Endicor system, we have encountered a Federation shuttlecraft which seems to have appeared out of nowhere. There are no indications of where it came from, or how it got out here." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. Part of the mystery has been solved. The reason there are two number 05 shuttlecrafts is because one of them is from the future. Six hours to be exact. And so, presumably, is the facsimile of me." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. I've been informed that Mr. Data has recovered the logs from the duplicate shuttlecraft. I am more than apprehensive to play back a log which will not be recorded for several hours." 

    'Captain's Log, supplemental. We continue on course to Endicor. We are now less than two hours away from our rendezvous with ourselves." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We have apparently intersected with something." (TNG: "Time Squared") 

Mission to Starbase Montgomery Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 42686.4. We are en route to Starbase Montgomery for engineering consultations prompted by minor readout anomalies." (TNG: "The Icarus Factor") 

Mission to Selcundi Drema Sector Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 42695.3. We're the first manned vessel to enter the Selcundi Drema sector. Unmanned probes have recorded unusual levels of geological activity in all five planetary systems. I am hoping the Enterprise will find the answer to this enigma." 

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 42696.3. We are entering the second Selcunidi star system where acting Ensign Crusher will begin his planetary mineral survey, the results of which may help unlock the geological puzzle." 

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 42737.3. It has been six weeks since our entrance into the Selcundi Drema sector. Each system has revealed the same disturbing geological upheavals on every planet." 

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 42741.3. We are entering into orbit of Drema IV, the planet from which Data received the distress signal. Sensors indicate that the volcanic activity is increasing." (TNG: "Pen Pals") 

First contact with Borg Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 42761.9. Despite Guinan's warning, I feel compelled to investigate this unexplored sector of the galaxy before heading back." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We have been attacked without provocation by an alien race which Guinan calls the Borg. It appears that we have neutralized their vessel. Commander Riker is leading an away team in an attempt to learn more about them." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We are unable to maintain the gap between the Enterprise and the Borg ship." (TNG: "Q Who") 

Mission to Starbase 515 Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 42779.1. We are en route to the Epsilon IX sector for an astronomical survey of a new pulsar cluster. In the meantime, Ensign Crusher will be diverting to Starbase 515 for Starfleet exams." 

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 42779.5. We have arrived at Starbase 515. I'm still quite uneasy, despite assurances that this medical procedure poses little risk." (TNG: "Samaritan Snare") 

Mission to Ficus Sector Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 42823.2. We are departing from Starbase 73 to investigate the source of a mysterious distress signal. Meanwhile, my security officer remains in sickbay where Dr. Pulaski is searching for the cause of his collapse." 

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 42827.3. Commander Riker has reached the caverns where he's making preparations for the evacuation." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. A review of stellar charts has revealed a class M planet only half a light year from the Bringloid system. I'm proceeding on the premise that it was the destination of the colony which possessed the more sophisticated equipment." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We are approaching the class M planet where we hope to find the other colonists." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. Prime Minister Granger has requested an urgent meeting to discuss the future of the Mariposan colony. I've invited him to the Enterprise."

Trade Agreements Conference Edit

    "Captain's log, stardate 43930.7. The Enterprise has been in attendance at the biennial Trade Agreements Conference on Betazed. For the first time, the Ferengi are present and I have reluctantly consented to their boarding the Enterprise for the closing reception." (TNG: "Ménage à Troi") 

Mission to Zeta Gelis cluster Edit

    "Captain's log, stardate 43957.2. We are charting an unexplored star system within the Zeta Gelis cluster. This routine assignment has made for a refreshingly quiet time aboard the Enterprise."

Diversion to Starbase 416 Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 44085.7. Due to a medical emergency we have been forced to cut short a two-day liberty on Ogus II and set course for Starbase 416. It seems a young man's practical joke has come dangerously close to a lethal conclusion."

Passing the Ngame Nebula Edit

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 44502.7. Early completion of our mission at Harrakis V has allowed me to grant extra personal time for many of the crew. This has come as something of a relief since our recent tight scheduling has prevented the pursuit of the leisure activities that are a normal part of life aboard the Enterprise. I expect our journey past the Ngame Nebula to be uneventful and am personally using the time to fulfill a promise to a colleague." 

The following two logs were recorded after encountering an apparent unstable wormhole. They were later erased from the Enterprise computer in an agreement with the Paxans.

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 44635.8. Four days have passed, but we have made little progress in solving the mystery of the Brattain. I have decided we should return to Starbase 220 and to that end, Commander La Forge is rigging the Brattain for towing." 

    "Captain's Log, Stardate 44639.9. We have now been adrift for a total of ten days. We have sent subspace distress calls, but because of our distant location, we cannot expect a response for at least another two weeks." 

    "Acting Captain's Log, Stardate 44642.1. I have assumed command of the Enterprise at the request of Captain Picard. Our situation is deteriorating; many of the crew are unable to function and our life support systems are beginning to falter." (TNG: "Night Terrors")

    "Captain's Log, stardate 44705.3. The Enterprise has destroyed the alien probe, but now we are left with the difficult task of repairing the Argus telescope. Failure to do so would represent an incalculable scientific loss."
    "Captain's Log, stardate 44721.9. After ten days in the company of the Cytherians, the Enterprise has been safely returned to Federation space. We bring back knowledge of their race that will take scholars decades to examine. Lieutenant Barclay is apparently no worse for his experience." (TNG: "The Nth Degree") 

Federation archeology symposium Edit
