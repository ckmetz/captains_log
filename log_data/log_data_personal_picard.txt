Captain's Personal Log: I trust my concern over the problems of ship's Counselor Troi are not based merely on losing a highly valuable crew member. But it seems to me that she is trapped by a custom of her homeworld which the facts of 24th century life have made unwise and unworkable. I wish I could intervene.
Captain's Personal Log: I'm entering the ship's holodeck where images of reality can be created by our ship's computer. Highly useful in crew training. Highly enjoyable when used for games and recreation.
Captain's Personal Log: I am delighted with how the holodeck has created the fictional world of Dixon Hill, the 20th century detective who's been a hero of mine since childhood. The characters are meta-generated by the computer, of course yet they feel real… they seem real in every way.

Captain's Personal Log, stardate 42779.5. We have arrived at Starbase 515. I'm still quite uneasy, despite assurances that this medical procedure poses little risk.
Captain's Personal Log, stardate 45025.4. It is with a profound sense of relief that I have ordered the fleet back to Federation territory following the Romulan withdrawal and the news of Gowron's victory. We have arrived at the Klingon homeworld where I will present the High Council with a full report on our encounter with the Romulans.
