Entries Edit
Discovery of Ocampa Edit

    "Captain's Log, stardate 48315.6. We've traced the energy pulses from the array to the fifth planet of the neighboring system and believe they may have been used in some fashion to transport Kim and Torres to the planet's surface." (VOY: "Caretaker") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. The Maquis ship and Voyager have encountered a debris field where sensors have detected a small vessel. One humanoid lifeform is on board." (VOY: "Caretaker") 

Routine maintenance Edit

    "Captain's Log, stardate 48439.7. As we maintain a course back to the Alpha Quadrant, we're conducting what would normally be routine maintenance to the ship. Routine, that is, if we had access to a starbase." (VOY: "Parallax") 

Search for dilithium Edit

    "Captain's Log, stardate 48532.4. We're on our way to a rogue planetoid, which Mister Neelix tells us is an extremely rich source of raw dilithium. If he's right, this could go a long way towards easing our power shortage." (VOY: "Phage") 

First contact with the Vidiians Edit

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We are pursuing the alien ship from the moon. They are not responding to hails and it appears that our two ships are evenly matched for speed." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. The aliens have successfully transplanted one of Kes's lungs into Neelix. The dampening field has been deactivated, and I have allowed them to beam back to their vessel. We are resuming a course home." (VOY: "Phage") 

Replenishing energy reserves Edit

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We set out to augment our energy reserves and wound up depleting them by over twenty percent. As a result, we've set a new course for a planet fourteen light years away that Neelix says might have compatible energy sources to offer us. It is out of our way, but circumstances offer few alternatives. So much for raising spirits." (VOY: "The Cloud") 

Discovery of microwormhole Edit

    "Captain's Log, stardate 48579.4. The crew has been scanning constantly for anomalies that might help us shorten our journey home. Ensign Kim has reported an exciting discovery. A subspace disturbance which may be a wormhole." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. Encouraged by his success in transmitting a signal to the Alpha Quadrant, Mister Kim is investigating the possibility of establishing a voice link with whoever is at the other end of the wormhole." (VOY: "Eye of the Needle") 

Discovery of new element Edit

    "Captain's Log, stardate 48623.5. There are 246 elements known to Federation science. We believe we have just discovered the 247th inside the ring system of a class D planet." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We've returned to the ring system, and we're preparing to send Ptera back to her dimension. Lieutenant Torres has found a way to temporarily protect the warp core against the vacuoles but she is uncertain how long her measures will be effective." (VOY: "Emanations") 

Shore leave on Sikaris Edit

    "Captain's Log, stardate 48642.5. The crew is enjoying an evening on Sikaris. They are discovering, to their delight, that reports of this species' hospitality have not been exaggerated." (VOY: "Prime Factors") 

Encounter with the Kazon Edit

    "Captain's Log, stardate 48658.2. We successfully left orbit without further interference from the Kazon. Commander Chakotay was injured, but is recovering from his wounds." (VOY: "State of Flux") 

Discovery of photonic activity Edit

    "Captain's Log, stardate 48693.2. We've altered course to investigate some unusually intense photonic activity in a nearby protostar. Lieutenant Torres and I are beaming aboard samples for further analysis." 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 48710.5. Since the return of our missing crewmen, we've been unable to locate any further traces of the photonic aliens." (VOY: "Heroes and Demons") 

Miscellaneous Edit

    "Captain's Log, stardate 48734.2. Sometimes it's a good idea to get away from being captain for a while. To that end, I've started participating in a new holonovel. The setting is ancient England." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. It appears that Mister Tuvok and Kes were both hit by an unidentified energy discharge. Tuvok was not badly hurt, but Kes is in a coma." 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 48735.9. We have returned to the coordinates where we ejected the warp core and have successfully retrieved it. Now we're hoping The Doctor will be able to successfully reintegrate Commander Chakotay's consciousness." (VOY: "Cathexis") 

Survey of Avery system Edit

    "Captain's Log, stardate 48784.2. We have completed our survey of the Avery system and are returning to retrieve Lieutenants Paris, Torres, and Durst. By now, they should have concluded their inspection of the magnesite formations on the third planet." (VOY: "Faces") 

Return to Rinax Edit

    "Captain's Log, stardate 48832.1. Kes has prevailed upon Neelix to allow Doctor Jetrel to continue metabolic scans in the hope that it will facilitate treatment once the antibody has been synthesized." 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 48840.5. Doctor Jetrel's metremia is now in its final stage. He's spending his remaining hours in sickbay." (VOY: "Jetrel") 

Gel pack contagion Edit

    "Captain's Log, stardate 48846.5. Ordinarily the loss of a gel pack would be a minor inconvenience, but here in the Delta Quadrant it's a reminder of the precarious nature of our journey." 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 48859.3. Lieutenant Tuvok has reported what may be a possible explanation for the infection in the bio-neural gel packs. I have asked Lieutenant Torres and her team to investigate Neelix's kitchen." (VOY: "Learning Curve") 

Procreation Edit

    "Captain's Log, stardate 48921.3. I continue to wonder about the issue of procreation aboard the ship. Certainly, it's wrong to interfere with the private lives and decisions of the crew, yet I remain concerned about the environment we could provide for any child born here." (VOY: "Elogium") 

Humans Edit

    "Captain's Log, stardate 48975.1. Evansville wasn't exaggerating when he said they have a lot to be proud of here. It was an amazing experience, but it's left me a little disturbed." (VOY: "The 37's") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We have no explanation for the mysterious disappearance of the telepathic alien. We can't even be certain that he was actually here. He seems to have left us with any number of unanswered questions." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We've arrived at what Tanis calls the meeting place, the region of space where Suspiria exists." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We've resumed our course back to the Alpha Quadrant but the female Caretaker is still out there with the power to send us home, and I will use all my power to find her and convince her to do just that." 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 49208.5. I have convened a meeting of the senior staff to determine how we can get close enough to the Nistrim ship to deploy the antiproton beam." 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 49211.5. Now that Commander Chakotay has made a full recovery, I'm faced with the difficult task of responding to his failure to follow procedure." 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 49337.4. After sending a subspace message to Seska and the Nistrim Maje Culluh, we have received a quick response." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We're on our way to rendezvous with Mister Neelix. I can only hope that he had more luck with the Kazon than we did." 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 49342.5. Neelix has returned from Sobras where he learned a disturbing piece of information that may require us to rethink our plans." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. Ensign Suder has been incarcerated in secured quarters where he will likely spend the rest of our journey home. Lieutenant Tuvok remains under observation in sickbay." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. I'm determined to find a better alternative to suicide or endless prison, so I've summoned the advocate Q to make him a proposal." 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 49301.2. We have assigned quarters to our new passenger, who has entered his name on our crew manifest as Quinn. I am anxious to engage him in ship activities as soon as possible." 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 49485.2. In spite of the fact that Tom Paris has been abducted by the Kazon, we must continue on course for the Hemikek system." 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 49548.7. There are no signs of any pursuing Vidiian vessels, and we have resumed a course toward home." 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. I've sent out scouting parties to analyze the mineral deposits in the moons around Drayan II. Meanwhile, I've arranged a meeting with the planet's leader." 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 49655.2. Our sensors have located a variety of flower which may prove to be a valuable nutritional supplement. I have sent Mister Neelix and Mister Tuvok to collect samples." 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 49678.4. It's been two weeks since the transporter accident that created Mister Tuvix. And, while it's still not entirely clear that he's with us permanently, he's certainly been doing his best to settle in. The crew seems to be growing accustomed to his presence, and he's proving to be a very able tactical officer who isn't afraid to express his opinions. While he's forging relationships with many of the officers, he seems to be keeping a respectful distance from Kes, allowing her to adjust to the circumstances on her own terms. As for my relationship with Tuvix, I've found him to be an able adviser who skillfully uses humor to make his points. And although I feel a bit guilty saying it, his cooking is better than Neelix's. My taste buds are definitely happy to have him around." 

    Captain's Log, stardate 50126.4. We have detected a gaseous anomaly that contains sirillium, a highly combustible and versatile energy source. We've altered course to investigate." (VOY: "Flashback") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 50156.2. After 72 hours, Lieutenant Paris and Ensign Kim are still missing, and I'm quickly losing patience with the Akritirian authorities. They continue to deny us access to the surface, and they've yet to confirm whether our crewmen were killed in the bombing." (VOY: "The Chute") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. So far we've located three ships with paralithium plasma emissions, but none of them appears to have produced explosives. We're currently in pursuit of a fourth vessel." (VOY: "The Chute") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 50074.3. We have detected evidence that a wormhole recently appeared and then disappeared in a nearby solar system. We're on our way there to investigate." (VOY: "False Profits") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 50074.5. Based on information provided by the probe, we have replicated local attire for Commander Chakotay and Lieutenant Paris. They have gone to the surface to investigate." (VOY: "False Profits") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. I've been asked to join Lieutenant Torres and Ensign Kim in the science lab to hear what they've termed as 'very exciting news'." (VOY: "False Profits") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. The away team has returned with some very disturbing observations about the situation on the planet." (VOY: "False Profits") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 50203.1. We're three days away from Enara Prime, home of the passengers we picked up from a colony in the Fima system. Our high warp capability has greatly reduced the time it normally takes them to make the journey home. In return, the Enarans have shared their energy conservation technology with us and, perhaps more importantly, their friendship." (VOY: "Remember") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 50211.4. We're approaching Enara and preparing to host a farewell party for our guests. They've made every effort to help us understand their telepathic abilities but it's still a mystery why they've affected Lieutenant Torres so strongly." (VOY: "Remember") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 50063.2. We've accepted an invitation from the Nechani to take a few days shore leave on their world. We're enjoying the opportunity to learn about their culture." (VOY: "Sacred Ground") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 50312.5. We are again in the Delta Quadrant, at the exact time and place we first encountered the timeship. I've resumed a course for Earth and I've ordered the crew to the mess hall for a toast." (VOY: "Future's End, Part II") 

    "Captains Log, stardate 50348.1. We've entered orbit around Ilari and sent a message to the Autarch inviting him to visit the ship. Instead, he'll be sending an official representative." (VOY: "Warlord") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 50351.4. We're holding a meeting with Demmas, the Autarch's eldest son and heir, in an effort to understand the recent hostile activity." (VOY: "Warlord") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. Demmas has decided to remain on board Voyager for the time being, but continues to monitor the worsening situation on Ilari." (VOY: "Warlord") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 50361.7. Lieutenant Tuvok hasn't reported for our scheduled rendezvous and we've been unable to contact him. We're now considering other more forceful options." (VOY: "Warlord") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 50384.2. Q's unannounced visits continue. Since I suspect he's up to something more than pursuing me, I've instructed the crew to take every opportunity to uncover his true motives." (VOY: "The Q and the Grey") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 50425.1. Mister Neelix and I have completed our three day trade mission with the Tak Tak, one of the more unusual species we've encountered in the Delta Quadrant. We are en route back to Voyager." (VOY: "Macrocosm") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. I have called a meeting of the senior staff to inform them of some very disturbing news I have just received." (VOY: "Fair Trade") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 50460.3. We've been investigating an inversion nebula for several days. This phenomenon has never been seen in the Alpha Quadrant and is proving something of a mystery to us here." (VOY: "Alter Ego") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We've completed sensor scans and confirmed our discovery of an unusual dampening field responsible for keeping this unstable nebula from going up in flames. The field's origin is still a mystery." (VOY: "Alter Ego") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 50518.6. The Doctor has examined me thoroughly and pronounced me physically fit, but I'll admit that it'll take a little longer to work through the emotional impact of my experience." (VOY: "Coda") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 50537.2. Routine scans of an uninhabited star system have revealed the presence of gallicite, a very rare substance, on the fourth planet." (VOY: "Blood Fever") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 50541.6. We're following through with Chakotay's offer to help the Sakari improve their camouflage and they've agreed to supply us with a generous quantity of gallicite." (VOY: "Blood Fever") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 50622.4. While Commander Chakotay scouts for a faster route through the Nekrit Expanse, we are continuing our month-long journey through this sparsely populated region." (VOY: "Unity") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We've detected a message buoy launched from Chakotay's shuttle and are heading toward it. The autopsy of the Borg corpse is underway." (VOY: "Unity") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 50693.2. We've been in orbit above an outpost of the Mikhal Travelers. This loosely governed race of explorers has extensive knowledge of the territory ahead of us, which they are willing to share." (VOY: "Darkling") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 50732.4. The Taresians have escorted us back to their homeworld so we can continue to investigate their claim that Ensign Kim is a member of their race." (VOY: "Favorite Son") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 50836.2. We've had long range communications with a seemingly friendly race known as the Vostigye. We'll be rendezvousing within the hour at one of their space stations." (VOY: "Real Life") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 50912.4. It's been twelve hours since these mysterious exchanges began. We still haven't discovered their cause. I've already lost over half my crew." (VOY: "Displaced") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 50929.6. The Nyrians have surrendered Voyager, and my crew is safely back on board. The former prisoners on the habitat vessel have contacted their native worlds, and are waiting to be taken home." (VOY: "Displaced") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 50984.3. It's been twelve hours since our confrontation with the alien lifeform. There's no sign that we're being pursued and we've had no further encounters with the Borg. I've decided to hold our course. The Northwest Passage is only one day away and I won't allow fear to undermine this crew's sense of purpose, even if that fear is justified." (VOY: "Scorpion") 

     "Captain's Log, stardate 51003.7. Three days, and no sign of Borg or bio-ships. We appear to be out of danger, but the entire crew is still on edge and so am I. Not even the calm of Master Leonardo da Vinci's workshop is enough to ease my mind." (VOY: "Scorpion, Part II") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. Warp drive is still offline and we don't know whether the Borg have detected us. Kes's psychokinetic abilities continue to damage the ship's structural integrity, and as a result our defenses have been compromised." (VOY: "The Gift") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 51082.4. After searching for more than two days we finally located what's left of Commander Chakotay's shuttle. I can only hope the Commander has fared better than his vessel." (VOY: "Nemesis") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 51096.5 Although Lieutenant Tuvok has managed to bring Commander Chakotay safely back to the ship, it may be some time before his psychological wounds are fully healed." (VOY: "Nemesis") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. I've assembled a team to analyze every square meter of the cargo bay. This has essentially been her quarters for the past two months. I'm determined to find something here that might shed some light on Seven of Nine's actions." (VOY: "The Raven") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. I've been trying to retrace Seven of Nine's footsteps, her actions during the last few days, but I'm still no closer to understanding what's happened." (VOY: "The Raven") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 51244.3. With the aliens gone, The Doctor has been able to remove their devices from the crew and neutralize the genetic tags." (VOY: "Scientific Method") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 51268.4. This morning's attack destroyed the power grid on deck 11. No casualties this time but the replicator system was badly damaged. We've gone to emergency rations. As a result, the situation has gotten a little worse. Environmental controls continue to fail. Seven decks have been rendered uninhabitable and we've had to relocate the crew. Quarters are close, nerves are frayed, and I'm not sure what's more difficult to maintain – Voyager's systems or the crew's morale. What's important is that we're together working toward a single goal... survival." (VOY: "Year of Hell") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 51425.4. Our condition has left us vulnerable to spatial anomalies and to any alien species eager for a piece of hardware. We've taken refuge in a class-9 nebula." (VOY: "Year of Hell, Part II") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 51682.2. I've forged a coalition with the Nihydron and the Mawasi. Together, we're preparing to attack the weapon ship." (VOY: "Year of Hell, Part II") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 51252.3. The past couple of weeks have been uneventful but we've made excellent progress on the new astrometrics lab." (VOY: "Year of Hell, Part II") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 51367.2. We've spent the last three days on the Mari homeworld. It's been a while since we've had the opportunity to make new friends and the crew seems to be making the most of our stay." (VOY: "Random Thoughts") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. Chief Examiner Nimira has taken custody of Mister Guill. Whether his arrest will lead to reforms in the Mari justice system is anyone's guess. In the meantime, The Doctor is treating Lieutenant Torres and Commander Tuvok." (VOY: "Random Thoughts") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 51386.4. With ship's systems at nearly half capacity it's taken us ten days to track our stolen technology." (VOY: "Concerning Flight") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 51408.3. We're back on course to the Alpha Quadrant. With the ship's computer and The Doctor's emitter returned to proper places, I've set aside some time to check on the Maestro." (VOY: "Concerning Flight") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 51449.2. After receiving a distress call from Commander Chakotay, we've sent a beacon into the nebula and we're in the process of tracking down the away team." (VOY: "Mortal Coil") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 51501.4. After two days at high warp we're close enough to the relay station to see it on long-range visual sensors." (VOY: "Hunters") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. Seven of Nine and Commander Tuvok suffered no serious physical damage after their encounter on the alien ship. I've been eager to hear Tuvok's impressions of the species who took them hostage." (VOY: "Hunters") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 51652.3. It's been twelve hours and our sensors show no sign of any Hirogen vessels, but their people are scattered throughout this region and something tells me that the hunt for Voyager is far from over." (VOY: "Prey") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 51679.4. We've detected the warp signature from Kovin's ship and we're now in pursuit. In the meantime, Tuvok and I have been examining the tools from Kovin's lab." (VOY: "Retrospect") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 51715.2. The damage to Voyager has been extreme. Both sides have taken heavy casualties and it's clear that no one is going to win this conflict. The fighting has reached a standstill and the remaining Hirogen have agreed to negotiate a truce." (VOY: "The Killing Game, Part II") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 51762.4. The repairs to Steth's coaxial drive have been completed well ahead of schedule." (VOY: "Vis à Vis") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. The Doctor has treated Mister Paris' phaser wounds but has been unable to wake him. The motive for his attack remains a mystery." (VOY: "Vis à Vis") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 51775.2. While the alien intruder remains trapped in the body of his last victim, The Doctor has found a way to return Tom, Steth, and me to our own bodies." (VOY: "Vis à Vis") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. Encrypt log entry. We're approaching the star system where we believe we'll find Omega. I have to admit, I have never been this apprehensive about a mission. I know how Einstein must've felt about the atom bomb, or Marcus when she developed the Genesis Device. They watched helplessly as science took a destructive course. But I have the chance to prevent that from happening. I just hope it's not too late." (VOY: "The Omega Directive") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 51793.4. We've arranged for our guests in sickbay to be taken back to their homeworld, and we can finally put this mission behind us. This will be my last encrypted log concerning the Omega Directive. The classified data files will now be destroyed." (VOY: "The Omega Directive") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. I've ordered adaptations to our shields to repel the thermionic discharges. Hoping that the benefits will outweigh the risks, we're now trying to beam deuterium from beneath the planet's surface." (VOY: "Demon") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. The Doctor continues to investigate Tom and Harry, whose condition seems as serious as it is strange." (VOY: "Demon") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 51978.2. It's been five months since we received the encoded message from the Alpha Quadrant. We know that the transmission was from Starfleet Command but we still can't decrypt it. B'Elanna thinks it's a lost cause, that too much of the data stream has been destroyed, but I haven't given up. I keep hoping inspiration will strike, somehow." (VOY: "Hope and Fear") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. After two days at high warp, we've rendezvoused with the Dauntless. Arturis has helped us reconstruct most of the Starfleet message. The pieces of this puzzle are finally coming together." (VOY: "Hope and Fear") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. So far, the crew hasn't found any evidence to support my doubts about Arturis. Nevertheless, I've told them to keep looking and to keep their optimism in check. But that's one order I don't expect them to follow to the letter. Despite my apprehension, I can't help but wonder what I'll be doing in three months' time. Still guiding Voyager through the Delta Quadrant, searching for a way home, or looking up old friends in Indiana?" (VOY: "Hope and Fear") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We remained in the quantum slipstream for an hour before it finally collapsed. Our diagnostics have concluded that we can't risk using this technology again, but we did manage to get three hundred light years closer to home." (VOY: "Hope and Fear") 

    Captain's Log, supplemental. This proto-nebula seems to have a mind of its own. It's still expanding, with no end in sight. We're holding at a safe distance to monitor its growth." (VOY: "Drone") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We've stepped up the pace of construction in order to finish our shuttle before the Malon finish theirs. According to Seven's most recent intelligence we've gained some ground over the last 24 hours putting us in a virtual dead heat with our competitors." (VOY: "Extreme Risk") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. Until we know exactly what's going on I'm keeping Voyager concealed behind a class 3 moon." (VOY: "In the Flesh") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 52136.4. We've managed to avoid a military conflict with Species 8472, at least for now. In an effort to strengthen the truce we're exchanging technology." (VOY: "In the Flesh") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. We've weathered the ion storm and tracked the Delta Flyer to an M-class planetoid." (VOY: "Once Upon a Time") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. Ensign Wildman has recovered from her injuries, and the Delta Flyer, though battered, is intact." (VOY: "Once Upon a Time") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. While The Doctor seems to be making progress, Commander Chakotay and I have hit a wall in our attempt to decipher the alien message." (VOY: "Nothing Human") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 52143.6. With any luck my next log entry will be made in the Alpha Quadrant, but should our luck run out, I'd like to say for the record that the crew of Voyager acted with distinction and valor." (VOY: "Timeless") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. Our slipstream flight may have been brief, but it took nearly ten years off our journey. I've given the order to dismantle the quantum drive until the technology can be perfected. Despite the setback, we have a renewed sense of momentum. It no longer seems a question of if we get home, but when." (VOY: "Timeless") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 52179.4. After salvaging the Delta Flyer, we've resumed our course toward the Alpha Quadrant. I now have to turn my attention to a matter of discipline." (VOY: "Thirty Days") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. Long range sensors have detected a vessel belonging to Species 6339. We've set a course to intercept them in the hopes they can help us restore Seven of Nine." (VOY: "Infinite Regress") 

    "Captain's Log, stardate 52356.2. After nearly a week of regeneration, Seven of Nine has finally recovered from her ordeal." (VOY: "Infinite Regress") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. After weeks of playing hide and seek with the Devore inspectors our goal is near. A transport vessel that will take our passengers to a wormhole leading out of hostile territory." (VOY: "Counterpoint") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. It's taken us nearly two days but we've managed to locate Torat, the man who's supposedly an expert on wormholes. Unfortunately, he seems reluctant to share his expertise." (VOY: "Counterpoint") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. It's been over an hour since the shuttle disappeared from sensors." (VOY: "Gravity") 

    "Captain's Log, supplemental. Our doctor is now our patient. It's been two weeks since I've ordered a round-the-clock vigil. A crew member has stayed with him at all times offering a sounding board and a familiar presence while he struggles to understand his memories and his thoughts. The chance of recovery? Uncertain."
